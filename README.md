# webScraper

* Searches listings on ksl.com for a Macbook pro within the $800 - $1000 price range
 with at least 256 GB of HD space. It then filters and sorts the results.

* Writes data from listings to a local file
 
* Make sure phantomjs and casperjs are installed with latest stable version.  (will probably get errors if using the non stable versions)

* Navigate to directory where downloaded and run program from terminal using: casperjs casperWebScraper.js
