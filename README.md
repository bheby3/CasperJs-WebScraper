# KSL Web Scraper

* Searches listings on KSL classifieds for a Macbook Pro within the $800 - $1000 price range with at least 256 GB of HD space. It then filters, sorts and styles the results.  Results are saved to an HTML file.  (With a little tweaking it could be used to search for just about anything on KSL classifieds).
 
* Make sure to install the latest stable versions Phantomjs and Casperjs.  (You will probably get errors if using nonstable versions)

* Navigate to directory where downloaded and run program from terminal using: casperjs casperWebScraper.js
